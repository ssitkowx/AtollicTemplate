# AtollicTemplate
# I. Description:
Template for Atollic embedded projects.

# II. Assumptions:
- The code depends on the environment in which it works,
- The code can use external libraries independent of the environment,
- Low-level hall libraries are generated by CubeMx.

# III. Structure:
The embedded project has been divided into two parts:
Hardware:
This is where the environment-specific code is kept.

Logic:
This is where external libraries and environment-dependent code are stored, but not hardware-dependent.

# IV. Configuration:
- Atollic TrueSTUDIOÂ® for STM32, Built on Eclipse Neon.1a. Version 9.3.1,
- Generate hal libraries from CubeMx,
- Add files, folders and libraries to the 'AtollicTemplate' project.

# V. Builidng:
- Open a project gui and build a project.

# VI. Builidng:
- Exclude 'main' from the build logic project.
