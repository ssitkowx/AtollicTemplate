# AtollicTemplate
# I. Description:
Template for Atollic embedded projects.

# II. Assumptions:
- The code depends on the environment in which it works,
- The code can use external libraries independent of the environment,
- Low-level hall libraries are generated by CubeMx.

# III. Structure:
The embedded project has been divided into two parts:
Hardware:
This is where the environment-specific code is kept.

Logic:
This is where external libraries and environment-dependent code are stored, but not hardware-dependent.

# IV. Configuration:
- Generate hal libraries from Cube
- Open Atollic True Studio project from 'AtollicTemplate' folder,
- Add files, folders and libraries to the project,

# V. Builidng:
- Open a project gui and build a project.
